## Environment variables and defaults

### Samba

* __ACCOUNT\_username__
    * multiple variables/accounts possible
    * adds a new user account with the given username and the env value as password

to restrict access of volumes you can add the following to your samba volume config:

    valid users = alice; invalid users = bob;

* __SAMBA\_CONF\_WORKGROUP__
    * default: _WORKGROUP_

* __SAMBA\_CONF\_SERVER\_STRING__
    * default: _file server_

* __SAMBA\_CONF\_MAP_TO_GUEST__
    * default: _Bad User_

* __SAMBA\_CONF\_ENABLE\_PASSWORD\_SYNC__
    * default not set - if set password sync is enabled

* __SAMBA\_CONF\_ENABLE\_NTLM\_AUTH__
    * default not set - if set password sync is enabled
    * _use for compatibility with xp if you have troubles like NTLMv1 passwords NOT PERMITTED for user_
    * !!! NOTE: NTLMv1 is known to be broken and it's easy to recover the real password from the hash !!!

* __SAMBA\_GLOBAL\_CONFIG\_myconfigname__
    * adds additional global configuration
    * multiple variables/confgurations possible by adding unique configname to SAMBA_GLOBAL_CONFIG_
    * examples
        * "SAMBA_GLOBAL_CONFIG_var1= min protocol = SMB2; fruit:metadata = stream"
        * "SAMBA_GLOBAL_CONFIG_var2= fruit:nfs_aces = no"

* __SAMBA\_VOLUME\_CONFIG\_myconfigname__
    * adds a new samba volume configuration
    * multiple variables/confgurations possible by adding unique configname to SAMBA_VOLUME_CONFIG_
    * examples
        * "[My Share]; path=/shares/myshare; guest ok = no; read only = no; browseable = yes"
        * "[Guest Share]; path=/shares/guests; guest ok = yes; read only = no; browseable = yes"

# Apple TimeMachine

To enable TimeMachine Support add this to your `SAMBA_VOLUME_CONFIG`: `vfs objects = catia fruit streams_xattr; fruit:time machine = yes;`

You can also limit the size available for timemachine by also adding `fruit:time machine max size = 500G;` (format: `SIZE [K|M|G|T|P]
`)

**Note**: As soon as a share is defined with a `fruit`-option, the following settings are defined within the global section:
* `fruit:aapl = yes`
* `vfs objects = catia fruit streams_xattr`

# Avahi / Zeroconf

## Infos:

* https://linux.die.net/man/5/avahi.service

You can't proxy the zeroconf inside the container to the outside, since this would need routing and forwarding to your internal docker0 interface from outside.

You can just expose the needed ports to the docker hosts port and install avahi.
After that just add a new service which fits to your config.

### Example Configuration

__/etc/avahi/services/smb.service__

    <?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?>
    <!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
    <service-group>

     <service>
       <type>_smb._tcp</type>
       <port>445</port>
     </service>
     <service>
       <type>_device-info._tcp</type>
       <port>0</port>
       <txt-record>model=RackMac</txt-record>
     </service>
    </service-group>

__/etc/avahi/services/smb.service__ (with TimeMachine Support - more infos: https://gist.github.com/ChloeTigre/4c2022c0d1a281deedba6f7539a2e3ae)

`SAMBA_VOLUME_CONFIG_timecapsule: "[Time Capsule]; path = /shares/TimeCapsule; valid users = johndoe; guest ok = no; read only = no; browseable = no; force user = nobody; force group = nogroup; force create mode = 0660; force directory mode = 2770; fruit:aapl = yes; fruit:time machine = yes; fruit:time machine max size = 2000G;"`

```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?>
